Due to different retinal degenerative diseases, many people lose their vision. Such loss significantly reduces their abilities to successfully participate in everyday life and the number of tasks they are able to accomplish. Furthermore, due to the low resolution of currently available certified bionic implants, several tasks (like objects differentiation and separation) are very hard or impossible. In this paper, we provide a method of combining the modern deep-learning models with graph theory to facilitate objects' location, identification, and visual separation from each other. We show that our approach steadily facilitates the mentioned task when objects are stacked or located near each other. We also provide ideas of possible improvements and extensions to this work to provide bionic implant users a better experience and facilitate their everyday lives.
